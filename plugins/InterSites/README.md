InterSites
==========

**Analyze how visitors navigate between your websites.**

## Description

Measures number of visits and unique visitors that have navigated across two or three specific websites.

_(Unique user is determined across websites using the fingerprint config\_id stored in the DB.)_

## Features

### See how many visitors visited more than one of your websites.

To access this functionality, navigate to the All Websites dashboard. Here there will be a new link that says _Number of visitors who viewed several websites_. Click this link and a dialog will display that will allow you to get visitor metrics for many sites.

Comparison of visits is done in dates for the UTC time, not for the site specific time.

### _Those are all the features available right now._

This plugin is very new, so there is only one. However! We have big plans for this plugin and will be working to include many new and mind-bending features.
