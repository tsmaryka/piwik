InterSites
==========

**Analyze how visitors navigate between your websites.**

## Description

Measures number of visits and unique visitors that have navigated across two or three specific websites.

_(Unique user is determined across websites using the fingerprint config\_id stored in the DB.)_

## Features

### See how many visitors visited more than one of your websites.

To access this functionality, navigate to the All Websites dashboard. Here there will be a new link that says _Number of visitors who viewed several websites_. Click this link and a dialog will display that will allow you to get visitor metrics for many sites.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Comparison of visits is done in dates for the UTC time, not for the site specific time.
